# Audio and Transcription

Video Indexer converts speech to text in 12 languages and allows extensions. Supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi, and Korean.

It can also automatically identify the dominant spoken language. Supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and Portuguese. If the language can't be identified with confidence, Video Indexer assumes the spoken language is English. For more information, see [Language identification model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/language-identification-model).

Multi-language speech identification and transcription allows you to automatically identifies the spoken language in different segments from audio. It sends each segment of the media file to be transcribed and then combines the transcription back to one unified transcription. For more information, see [Automatically identify and transcribe multi-language content](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/multi-language-identification-transcription).
