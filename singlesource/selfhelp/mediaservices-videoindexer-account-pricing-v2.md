Video Indexer can be used with two types of accounts:
* *Free trial account:* up to 10 hours of free indexing for website users, and up to 40 hours of free indexing for API users.
* *Paid unlimited account:* for larger-scale indexing, create a new Video Indexer account connected to a paid Microsoft Azure subscription.
Pricing is based on the duration of the input file. Indexing is charged for audio analysis, video analysis or both. The service takes advantage of your Media Reserved Units to process tasks in parallel when possible.

Price per input minute:
* Video analysis - $0.15
* Audio analysis - $0.04
