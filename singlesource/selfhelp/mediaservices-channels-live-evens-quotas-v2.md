# Manage quotas of Channels (v2)/Live Events (v3)

## Fix this problem now using our expert solution
Expert solutions are written by Azure engineers to help you quickly resolve the problem on your own.
<br><br><br>


There is a default (soft) limit of 5 live Channels (v2) and Live Events (v3) per Media Services account. You can open a support ticket to increase this quota. Make sure to include detailed information in the request on the desired quota changes, including your region and scale information.

**NOTE**: Currently, you cannot use the Azure portal to manage v3 resources. Use the [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref), [CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref), or one of the supported [SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/developers-guide).
