### Troubleshoot slow audio and video indexing

When using a Video or Audio Analyzer presets, use the Azure portal or the CLI to set your account to have at least  10 "S3" Media Reserved Units. For more information, see [Scale media analytics and indexing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-scale-media-processing-overview).
