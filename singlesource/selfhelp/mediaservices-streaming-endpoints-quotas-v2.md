# Manage Streaming Endpoints quotas

## Learn how to manage Streaming Endpoints quotas
When you create a Media Services account, a default Standard streaming endpoint is created for you in a stopped state. You can create more streaming endpoints under the account. Learn more about [Streaming Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/stream-streaming-endpoint-concept).

If you have advanced workloads or would like dedicated and scalable bandwidth capacity, a Premium streaming endpoint may be more suitable. You can move to a Premium type by adjusting the streaming units for your streaming endpoint. The maximum streaming unit limit is usually 10, but you can contact Support to increase this limit as needed.

There is a limit of 2 Streaming Endpoints per Media Services account. This quota applies to stopped or running Streaming Endpoints. If you require more, contact Support to help you do so.
