# Manage a Video Indexer account connected to Azure

[Learn how to manage a Video Indexer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/manage-account-connected-to-azure) that's connected to your Azure subscription and an Azure Media Services account. You will learn how to:
* Examine your account settings
* Repair the connection to Azure
* Autoscale reserved units
* Handle Errors and warnings

## Manage multiple tenants

[Learn about the different options for managing multiple tenants with Video Indexer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/manage-multiple-tenants). Choose a method that is most suitable for your scenario:
* Video Indexer account per tenant
* Single Video Indexer account for all tenants
* Azure subscription per tenant

## Invite users to Video Indexer

To collaborate with your colleagues, you can [invite them to your Video Indexer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/invite-users) by adding their email addresses.

## Video Indexer failover and disaster recovery

Azure Media Services Video Indexer doesn't provide instant failover of the service if there's a regional datacenter outage or failure. [Learn how to configure your environment for a failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-disaster-recovery) to ensure optimal availability for apps and minimized recovery time if a disaster occurs. We recommend that you configure business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR) across regional pairs to benefit from Azure's isolation and availability policies.
