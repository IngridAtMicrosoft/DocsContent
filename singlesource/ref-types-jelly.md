# Types of jelly

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| jelly | In North America, jelly (from the French gelée) refers exclusively to a clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable) juice—thus differing from jam by excluding the fruit's flesh—and is set by using its naturally occurring pectin, whereas outside North America jelly more often refers to a gelatin-based dessert, though the term is also used to refer to clear jams such as blackcurrant and apple. In the United Kingdom, redcurrant jelly is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday roast. It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining. |
| jam | Jam typically contains both the juice and flesh of a fruit or vegetable, although one cookbook defines it as a cooked and jelled puree. The term "jam" refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then heated with water and sugar to activate its pectin before being put into containers |

| chutney | A chutney is a relish of Indian origin made of fruit, spices and herbs. Although originally intended to be eaten soon after production, modern chutneys are often made to be sold, so require preservatives – often sugar and vinegar – to ensure they have a suitable shelf life. Mango chutney, for example, is mangoes reduced with sugar. |
| *confit* | While *confit*, the past participle of the French verb *confire*, "to preserve", is most often applied to preservation of meats, it is also used for fruits or vegetables seasoned and cooked with honey or sugar till jam-like. Savory *confits*, such as ones made with garlic or fennel, may call for a savory oil, such as virgin olive oil, as the preserving agent. |
| conserve | A conserve, or whole fruit jam, is a preserve made of fruit stewed in sugar. Traditional whole fruit preserves are particularly popular in Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) where they are called *varenye*, the Baltic region where they are known by a native name in each of the countries (Lithuanian: *uogienė*, Latvian: *ievārījums*, Estonian: moos, Romanian: *dulceață*), as well as in many regions of Western, Central and Southern Asia, where they are referred to as *murabba*. In some parts of Eastern Europe, another version called *slatko* is made; in Serbia and Croatia, a spoonful is offered to guests, along with a glass of water. |
| fruit butter | Fruit butter, in this context, refers to a process where the whole fruit is forced through a sieve or blended after the heating process. |
| fruit curd | Fruit curd is a dessert topping and spread usually made with lemon, lime, orange, or raspberry. The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice and zest which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, intensely flavored spread. Some recipes also include egg whites or butter. |
| fruit spread | Although the FDA has Requirements for Specific Standardized Fruit Butters, Jellies, Preserves, and Related Products, there is no specification of the meaning of the term fruit spread. Although some assert it refers to a jam or preserve with no added sugar, there are many "fruit spreads" by leading manufacturers that do contain added sugar. |
