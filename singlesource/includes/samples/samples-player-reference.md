# Media Services v3 Player samples

This article is a listing of all of the Media Services Player code samples for Node.JS, Python, and Java.

## 3rd party player samples

Try various players such as Shaka, Video.js, and THEOPlayer with the [3rd party player samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-3rdparty-player-samples).


## Shaka player with Timed Metadata for live event interactivity

This sample shows how to use the Google Shaka player with Low latency HLS streams to receive timed metadata events and display interactive information overlayed on the video element. This can be used to build interactive ads, quiz shows, polling, and other solutions that require events to be triggered in your web page or application during a live stream.
