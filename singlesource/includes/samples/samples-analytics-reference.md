# Media Services v3 Analytic samples

This article is a listing of all of the Media Services Analytics code samples for Node.JS, Python, and Java.

## Basic Audio Analytics with per-job language override

This sample illustrates how to create a audio analyzer transform using the basic mode.  It also shows how you can override the preset language on a per-job basis to avoid creating a transform for every language.  It also shows how to upload a media file to an input asset, submit a job with the transform and download the results for verification.
