1. Created list of all Azure resources in alphabetical order by using the CLI command: 
```
az provider list --query "sort_by([].{namespace:namespace, resourceTypes:resourceTypes[].resourceType}, &namespace)" --output json
```
2. Use the resulting JSON file to create 26 markdown pages to be able to do run scripts in batches. The tables have been populated with resource namespaces and resource types.

We now need to populate the third column in each of the tables:

The third column, "Data Produced," is for listing the types of Azure Monitor data generated by each resource type. This typically includes:

Metrics: Quantitative measurements (e.g., CPU usage, memory, request count).
Logs: Diagnostic, activity, or audit logs (e.g., Activity Log, Resource Log, Diagnostic Log).
Alerts: Monitoring alerts or events.
Insights: Specialized monitoring data (e.g., Application Insights telemetry).
For each resource, you should specify which of these data types are available (e.g., "Metrics, Logs," "Activity Log," "Diagnostic Log," etc.). If a resource does not produce Azure Monitor data, leave the column blank.

**Phase 1 Analysis Completed**

Successfully analyzed the example documentation structure in `tools2/examples/reference/` directory. Created comprehensive analysis document (`analysis.md`) that identifies:


The analysis provides a complete mapping of what needs to be built to reproduce the example documentation exactly. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Data Collection) upon approval.
