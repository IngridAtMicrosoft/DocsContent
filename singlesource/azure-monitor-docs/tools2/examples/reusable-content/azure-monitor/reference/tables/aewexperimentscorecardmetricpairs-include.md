| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _BilledSize | real | The record size in bytes |
| ControlCount | long | The sample count of the control variant. |
| ControlMetricValue | real | The metric value for the control variant. |
| ControlMetricValueNormalized | real | The normalized metric value for the control variant. Used by metric comparisons, which accounts for unequal traffic allocation. |
| ControlStandardErrorNormalized | real | The standard error (StandardDeviation / sqrt(Count)) of the metric for the control variant. |
| ControlVariant | string | The Id of the control variant. |
| DesiredDirection | string | Desirable direction for the metric. Possible values: Increase, Decrease, Neutral |
| Insights | dynamic | Metric-level Insights derived from the analysis results in JSON format. |
| _IsBillable | string | Specifies whether ingesting the data is billable. When _IsBillable is `false` ingestion isn't billed to your Azure account |
| MetricDescription | string | The description of the metric. |
| MetricDisplayName | string | The display name of the metric. |
| MetricETag | string | The ETag of the metric. |
| MetricId | string | The Id of the metric. |
| MetricKind | string | The metric kind. Possible values include EventCount, UserCount, EventRate, UserRate, Sum, Average, Percentile. |
| MetricLifecycle | string | The lifecycle stage of the metric. Possible values include Active, Inactive |
| MetricTags | dynamic | Metric tags in the form of string array. |
| MetricVersion | string | The version of the metric. |
| PValue | real | The P-Value of the comparison. Used to indicate if the difference between the variants is significant. |
| RelativeDifference | real | The relative difference of the comparison based on TreatmentMetricValueNormalized and ControlMetricValueNormalized. |
| _ResourceId | string | A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with |
| ScorecardId | string | The Id of the experiment scorecard. |
| SourceSystem | string | The type of agent the event was collected by. For example, `OpsManager` for Windows agent, either direct connect or Operations Manager, `Linux` for all Linux agents, or `Azure` for Azure Diagnostics |
| _SubscriptionId | string | A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with |
| TenantId | string | The Log Analytics workspace ID |
| TimeGenerated | datetime | The timestamp when the scorecard results were ingested. |
| TreatmentCount | long | The sample count of the treatment variant. |
| TreatmentEffect | string | The effect of the treatment variant on the metric. Possible values: Zero samples, Too few samples, Inconclusive, Changed, Improved, Degraded. |
| TreatmentMetricValue | real | The metric value for the treatment variant. |
| TreatmentMetricValueNormalized | real | The normalized metric value for the treatment variant. Used by metric comparisons, which accounts for unequal traffic allocation. |
| TreatmentStandardErrorNormalized | real | The standard error (StandardDeviation / sqrt(Count)) of the metric for the control variant. |
| TreatmentVariant | string | The Id of the treatment variant. |
| Type | string | The name of the table |
