## Custom metrics 

You can also send your own metrics into the Azure Monitor Metrics database by using the Azure Monitor REST API. Then you can view them in the Azure portal and alert on them like any other metrics. For more information, see [Collect custom metrics from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-custom-overview).
