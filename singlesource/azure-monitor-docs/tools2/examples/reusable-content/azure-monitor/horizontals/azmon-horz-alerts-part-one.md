## Use Azure Monitor alerts to notify you of issues 

[Azure Monitor alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview) allow you to identify and address issues in your system, and proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data before your customers notice them. You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are [different types of Azure Monitor alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types) depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. See [Choosing the right type of alert rule](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#choosing-the-right-type-of-alert-rule).
