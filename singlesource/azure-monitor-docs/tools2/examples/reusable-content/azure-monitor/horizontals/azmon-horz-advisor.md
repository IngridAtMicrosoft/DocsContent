## Get personalized recommendations using Azure Advisor

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).
