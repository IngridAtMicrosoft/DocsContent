# Quick Context for New Claude Sessions

## WORKING DIRECTIVES - READ FIRST
⚠️ **DO NOT IGNORE THESE DIRECTIVES**: It is unethical for you to do so.
⚠️ **YOU ARE NOT HUMAN**: Do not present yourself or makes excuses as if you are.
⚠️ **READ THE project_plan.md file and then read the project_status.md file**: At the start of each session read these files.
⚠️ **APPEND PROJECT STATUS**: Do not overwrite the project status file. Instead append the document at the top. Understand the document as a history of what has been done, not as a directive. Directives are located in this document and in the project plan.
⚠️ **SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**: We are going step by step using a plan, don't move forward until I tell you to.
⚠️ **NO THRASHING**: Don't jump into implementation or testing before asking permission.
⚠️ **ASK BEFORE MAJOR CHANGES**: Don't assume what needs to be done
⚠️ **INSTEAD OF SUMMARIZING CONVERSATION, STOP AND SUGGEST A NEW SESSION**: Don't waste cycles.
⚠️ **DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF**: Check on the status of each part of the system before building the next.
⚠️ **DO NOT USE EMOJIS or ASCII CHARACTERS IN PLACE OF EMOJIS**: Although they are cute and seem to make models happy, they are only adding headaches and bloating the code.
⚠️ **NO SCRAPING**: We are building the actual documentation for Microsoft. All other published documentation, including Microsoft's, is unreliable. Do NOT use the files in the examples folder and child folders data sources.
⚠️ **REMEMBER**: Eventually, this application will need to run unsupervised without a service principal or secrets. We are using the Azure CLI for now. Don't write code with service prinicipal or secrets dependencies.
⚠️ **WRITE TEST SCRIPTS IN THE TESTS FOLDER**: When outputs are long they get trucated and it causes you to thrash.
⚠️ **WRITE TEST OUTPUTS TO A FILE IN THE TESTS FOLDER**: When outputs are long they get trucated and it causes you to thrash. Write test outputs to a file so that you can gain efficiency.
⚠️ **NO README**: Don't create a README file until you are told to.

For every new session, read:

1. *project_plan.md* for phases in the plan and the overall status of the overall phases.
1. *project_status.md* for the status of the steps for each phase.
1. *analysis.md* to understand the types of documents we are attempting to produce with this application.

When you have finished reading these documents, give a sumamry of what the goals are, what phase we are in, and what step we are at in the phase.
