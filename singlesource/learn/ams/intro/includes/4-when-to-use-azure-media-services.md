Azure Media Services might not be the best option if you are a small business or individual.

| **Criteria** | **Analysis** |
| --- | --- |
| **Encoding** | Will you need to reach viewers on a variety of devices, browsers, and Internet connection speeds? |
| **Video on demand (VOD_** | Do you need to deliver a library of videos to viewers when they want it?  |
| **Live streaming** | Will you need to reach an audience in real time? |
| **Protected content** | Do you want to restrict access to content, for example, based on whether a viewer has paid for a subscription to your application?  |
| **Security** | Will you be plugging your streaming application into a VNet? Will you need to restrict IP access? |
| **Scale** | Is your audience geographically distributed enough to need a CDN? |
| **IT professional resources** | Do you have developers or DevOps staff to handle the application development and maintenance? |
