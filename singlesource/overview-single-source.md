# Overview: Single-sourcing documentation

This is is an example of using GitHub and the Docs build for creating single source, structured documentation with the ultimate goal of content reuse.

## DITA: traditional single source documentation

Darwin Typing Information Architecture(DITA) is the model we are using to create these pages.  DITA XML itself may not be used, as there is an objection to writing in XML, but the modularity and reuse principals are used here.

## Modularity and reuse

Technical documentation that does not take advantage of structured, single-source methods has a high overhead in that there is redundancy in what is written. This means a workload that could be lessened if content was reused.

## Metadata
