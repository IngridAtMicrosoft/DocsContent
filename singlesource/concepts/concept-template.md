<!--
This concept template has been created to make concept content SEO compliant.

## SEO Rules

- At least 2 but no more than 5 H2 level headings.  If you have more than that, then you are teaching too much. Consider breaking the content down into two or more how-tos.
- Titles should be no longer than 70 characters and should not break into a second line.
- The title in the metadata should match the title in the document.
- If possible, the title in the TOC should match the title of the document. Otherwise remove articles from the title and see if that works.
- Descriptions should be long and contain as many keywords as possible.
- Concepts are NOT task-based documents. Task-based content goes in an instructional content type such as a How-To.
- Concepts cover WHAT, WHY and WHEN.  What is the thing being described? Why would you want to use it? When do you use it?

## Content rules

- Screenshots should only be used when what needs to be done can't be adequately explained by text.  They can be used to introduce a user interface, but should NOT be used to illustrate tasks.
- Screenshot alt-text should describe what is in the image.  Make an effort at describing what you see.
- Diagrams should be used in concepts as they are for explaining architectures/sequences (see UML standards).

## H2 Limits

If you find that you need to create more than 5 H2 headings, the you should break the content into several pages. This helps the user consume information in smaller chunks.

## Same file different versions

This concept template uses monikers.  That way, concepts can be in one place for all versions.  If the same content applies to several versions, you designate the section with an operator preceding the version such as >, <, >=, <=. In other words, it isn't necessary to write the same thing over again and put it within a different moniker set.  Just add the operator to the range value.
