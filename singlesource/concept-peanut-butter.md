## Peanut butter

Peanut butter is a food pate or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It
often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as
salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries.
The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and itself consumes
\$800 million of peanut butter annually.

Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to
make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used
in a number of breakfast dishes and desserts, such as peanut-flavored granola,
smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants. It is similar to other nut
butters such as cashew butter and almond butter.
