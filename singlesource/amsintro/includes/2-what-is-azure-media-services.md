Let's start with some media streaming concepts.

## What is a media streaming?

Media streaming is best understood in comparison of downloading content. When content is downloaded, the entire file is delivered to the end user and the file is saved locally. With streaming, however, chunks of media content are continuously delivered to a client player in data packets. The content is not saved on the user's computer.

## What is a video on demand (VOD)?

Video on demand (VOD) is video that can be watched any time rather than only at a scheduled time.

## What is live streaming?

Live streaming is the delivery of live video and/or audio content to an audience close to the time when the content is being produced.

## What is encoding?

Encoding is the process of converting files containing digital video and/or audio from one standard format to another, with the purpose of:

- reducing the size of the files
- producing a format that's compatible with a broad range of devices and apps.

## What is packaging and delivery?

With Media Services, a streaming endpoint (origin) represents a dynamic (just-in-time) service that can deliver your live and on-demand content directly to a client player. It uses one of the common streaming media protocols HLS, DASH, and Smooth Streaming.

## What is content protection or Digital Rights Management (DRM)?

Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a way of protecting content from being played unless certain criteria are met such as allowing playback during a period of time or only by certain devices. DRM technologies include Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine, and Microsoft's PlayReady.

## What is a video analysis?

Media Services lets you extract insights from your video and audio files using audio and video analyzer presets. The presets include language detection, speech-to-text, and face detection.

## Azure Media Services definition

Azure Media Services is a cloud-based platform that enables you to build solutions that achieve broadcast-quality video streaming, enhance accessibility and distribution, analyze content, and much more. Whether you're an app developer, a call center, a government agency, or an entertainment company, Media Services helps you create apps that deliver media experiences of outstanding quality to large audiences on today's most popular mobile devices and browsers.

- Deliver videos in various formats so they can be played on a wide variety of browsers and devices. For both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (mobile devices, TV, PC, and so on), the video and audio content needs to be encoded and packaged appropriately.
- Stream live sporting events to a large online audience, like soccer, baseball, college and high school sports, and more.
- Broadcast public meetings and events, like town halls, city council meetings, and legislative bodies.
- Analyze recorded videos or audio content. For example, to achieve higher customer satisfaction, organizations can extract speech-to-text and build search indexes and dashboards. Then, they can extract intelligence around common complaints, sources of complaints, and other relevant data.
- Create a subscription video service and stream DRM protected content when a customer (for example, a movie studio) needs to restrict the access and use of proprietary copyrighted work.
- Deliver offline content for playback on airplanes, trains, and automobiles. A customer might need to download content onto their phone or tablet for playback when they anticipate to be disconnected from the network.
- Enable Azure CDN to achieve large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads (for example, the start of a product launch event).
